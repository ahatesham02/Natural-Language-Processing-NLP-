# News Classifier Project

News media has become a channel to pass on the information of whatâ€™s happening in the world to the people living. Often people perceive whatever conveyed in the news to be true. There were circumstances where even the news channels acknowledged that their news is not true as they wrote. But some news has a significant impact not only on the people or government but also on the economy. One news can shift the curves up and down depending on the emotions of people and political situation.

It is important to identify the fake news from the real true news. The problem has been taken over and resolved with the help of Natural Language Processing tools which help us identify fake or true news based on historical data. The news is now in safe hands!
